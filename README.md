# HomeWorksDimaSribnyj
Hello, my name is Dima Sribnyj and I am a learning programming languages in Course "Logika". This repository was made to send homeworks and this repository doesn't have some point besides homework, but if you wanna read (ONLY RUS AND UA) and copy my code, okay, you can git clone. So have a nice morning/day/evening/night!
